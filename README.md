# Nexus: The AI-Powered Semiconductor Engineering Assistant

## Project Overview
**Nexus** is a proof-of-concept **Agentic AI Platform** designed to demonstrate the future of engineering at **Arm**. It serves as an intelligent co-pilot for hardware architects and verification engineers, automating the translation of high-level specifications into compliant RTL designs and verification plans.

This project was built to showcase the capabilities required for the **AI Solutions Architect** role, specifically focusing on:
- **Agentic AI**: Multi-agent orchestration for complex problem solving (Planning, Coding, Reviewing).
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Context-aware answers based on technical specifications (e.g., AMBA AXI, ARMv9).
- **Guardrails & Evaluation**: Ensuring generated code meets strict syntax and safety standards.
- **Scalable Architecture**: A modular design ready for enterprise deployment.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

### High-Level Design
Nexus operates on a **Hub-and-Spoke Agentic Architecture**:

1.  **Orchestrator Agent (The "Lead")**: Deconstructs user requests (e.g., "Create an AXI4-Lite Slave module") into sub-tasks.
2.  **Knowledge Agent (The "Researcher")**: Uses RAG to retrieve precise protocol constraints from indexed documentation.
3.  **RTL Agent (The "Implementer")**: Generates Verilog/SystemVerilog code based on requirements and retrieved context.
4.  **Verification Agent (The "Tester")**: Generates UVM testbench skeletons and SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) to verify the design.
5.  **Guardrails Layer**: Static analysis tools (linting) to validate outputs before presenting them to the user.

### Technology Stack
- **Core Logic**: Python 3.10+
- **LLM Orchestration**: LangChain / LangGraph
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (for RAG)
- **API Interface**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for rapid, interactive prototyping).

## 🧠 Core Concepts Explained

### 1. Orchestrated (The "Brain")
The **NexusOrchestrator** serves as the central manager. It receives raw engineering requests, analyzes the intent, and systematically coordinates the underlying agents. Instead of a simple chatbot response, the system breaks down complex tasks, calls the RAG system for context, and then constructs the final prompt for the LLM. This demonstrates a true **Agentic Workflow**.

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
To prevent "hallucinations" and ensure technical accuracy, Nexus uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture. The system ingests the **AMBA AXI4 Protocol Specifications** into a local vector database (`ChromaDB`). When a user requests an "AXI Slave," the system searches this database, retrieves the exact signal definitions (e.g., `AWVALID`, `WREADY`), and grounds its response in Arm's official documentation.

### 3. RTL (Register Transfer Level)
The **RTL Generator** persona takes the retrieved specifications and produces synthesizable Verilog/SystemVerilog code. This automates the creation of boilerplate hardware logic, allowing engineers to focus on high-level architecture rather than repetitive coding tasks.

### 4. Verified (Quality Control)
Design is incomplete without verification. The **Verification Expert** agent capability ensures that generated designs are testable. Nexus can generate SystemVerilog testbenches (UVM or simple) alongside the design, acknowledging that verification often consumes the majority of the engineering effort.

## 🎯 Use Case: Accelerating IP Development
**Scenario**: An engineer needs a customized **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Bridge**.

1.  **Input**: Engineer types: *"Generate an APB bridge with 32-bit data width and PREADY support."*
2.  **Process**:
    - *Orchestrator* parses intent.
    - *Knowledge Agent* looks up APB protocol specs for signal timing.
    - *RTL Agent* writes the Verilog module.
    - *Verification Agent* creates a testbench to check `PENABLE` and `PSEL` timing.
3.  **Output**: A fully formed, lint-checked code snippet + verification plan.

## Local Model Setup (Optional but Recommended)
To run fully locally without API keys:
1.  **Install Ollama**: Download and install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/).
    > **Note**: You *must* install the Ollama application manually. The script cannot do this for you.
2.  **Pull the Model**: The `run_demo.sh` script will attempt to auto-pull `llama3` if Ollama is installed. You can also do it manually:
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
3.  In the Nexus UI, select **"Local (Ollama - Llama3)"** from the dropdown.

## Data Ingestion (RAG)
To populate the Knowledge Base with the latest specs:
```bash
python3 ingest_data.py
```
This will read all text files in `backend/data/specs`, chunk them, and store embeddings in `backend/data/chroma_db`.

Nexus directly addresses this by:
- **Reducing Boilerplate**: Automating repetitive coding tasks.
- **Democratizing Knowledge**: Making complex specs instantly queryable.
- **Ensuring Quality**: Embedding verification early in the design loop.
