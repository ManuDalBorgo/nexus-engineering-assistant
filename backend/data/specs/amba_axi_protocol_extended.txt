AMBA AXI4 Protocol Specification (Extended Summary)

1. Introduction
The AMBA AXI protocol is a burst-based protocol for high-bandwidth, low-latency on-chip communication.

2. Signal Descriptions
- Global Signals: ACLK (Clock), ARESETn (Reset, active low).

2.1 Write Address Channel (AW)
- AWADDR: Write address.
- AWVALID: Master valid signal.
- AWREADY: Slave ready signal.
- AWID: Write address ID.
- AWLEN: Burst length. The burst length gives the exact number of transfers in a burst. This information determines the number of data transfers associated with the address.
- AWSIZE: Burst size. This signal indicates the size of each transfer in the burst.
- AWBURST: Burst type.
- AWLOCK: Lock type.
- AWCACHE: Cache type.
- AWPROT: Protection type.

2.2 Write Data Channel (W)
- WDATA: Write data.
- WSTRB: Write strobes.
- WLAST: Write last.
- WVALID: Master valid signal.
- WREADY: Slave ready signal.

2.3 Write Response Channel (B)
- BRESP: Write response.
- BVALID: Slave valid signal.
- BREADY: Master ready signal.
- BID: Response ID.

2.4 Read Address Channel (AR)
- ARADDR: Read address.
- ARVALID: Master valid signal.
- ARREADY: Slave ready signal.
- ARID: Read address ID.
- ARLEN: Burst length.
- ARSIZE: Burst size.
- ARBURST: Burst type.
- ARLOCK: Lock type.
- ARCACHE: Cache type.
- ARPROT: Protection type.

2.5 Read Data Channel (R)
- RDATA: Read data.
- RRESP: Read response.
- RLAST: Read last.
- RVALID: Slave valid signal.
- RREADY: Master ready signal.
- RID: Read ID.

3. Handshake Process
All five channels use the same VALID/READY handshake mechanism.
- The source generates the VALID signal to indicate when the address, data, or control information is available.
- The destination generates the READY signal to indicate that it can accept the information.
- Transfer occurs only when both the VALID and READY signals are HIGH.
- A source is not permitted to wait until READY is asserted before asserting VALID.
- A destination is permitted to wait for VALID to be asserted before asserting READY.

4. Burst Types (AxBURST)
- FIXED (0b00): The address remains the same for every transfer in the burst. Useful for FIFO access.
- INCR (0b01): The address increments for each transfer in the burst. Most common type.
- WRAP (0b10): The address wraps around a boundary. Useful for cache line fills.

5. Ordering Model
AXI4 supports out-of-order transaction completion.
- Transactions with different ID values can complete out of order.
- Transactions with the same ID value must complete in order.

6. AXI4-Lite
AXI4-Lite is a subset of the AXI4 protocol intended for communication with simpler, smaller control register-style components.
- All transactions are burst length of 1.
- All data accesses are the same size as the data bus width.
- No exclusive accesses.
- No locked accesses.
- No ID signals (all transactions are assumed to be in order).
