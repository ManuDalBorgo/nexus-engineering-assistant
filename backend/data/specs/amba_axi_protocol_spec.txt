AMBA AXI4 Protocol Specification (Excerpt)

1. Introduction
The AMBA AXI protocol is a burst-based protocol for high-bandwidth, low-latency on-chip communication.

2. Signal Descriptions
- Global Signals: ACLK (Clock), ARESETn (Reset, active low).
- Write Address Channel: AWADDR, AWVALID, AWREADY, AWID, AWLEN, AWSIZE, AWBURST.
- Write Data Channel: WDATA, WSTRB, WLAST, WVALID, WREADY.
- Write Response Channel: BRESP, BVALID, BREADY, BID.
- Read Address Channel: ARADDR, ARVALID, ARREADY, ARID, ARLEN, ARSIZE, ARBURST.
- Read Data Channel: RDATA, RRESP, RLAST, RVALID, RREADY, RID.

3. Handshake Process
All five channels use the same VALID/READY handshake mechanism.
- The source generates the VALID signal to indicate when the address, data, or control information is available.
- The destination generates the READY signal to indicate that it can accept the information.
- Transfer occurs only when both the VALID and READY signals are HIGH.

4. Burst Types (AxBURST)
- FIXED (0b00): The address remains the same for every transfer in the burst. Useful for FIFO access.
- INCR (0b01): The address increments for each transfer in the burst. Most common type.
- WRAP (0b10): The address wraps around a boundary. Useful for cache line fills.

5. Atomic Accesses
AXI4 removes support for Locked transactions but retains Exclusive accesses for semaphore type operations.
